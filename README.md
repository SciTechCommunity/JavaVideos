# JavaVideos
Scripts and code examples for introduction to Java. You can contribute to as many modules as you want and multiple people can work on the same module.

## Guidelines
- Add your name to the readMe of the modules you work in
- Do all of your work in a branch and keep up in the projects server so we know how you are doing
- We highly recommend following the example module
